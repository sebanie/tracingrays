// you can likely use those in the skeleton code.


// This is a simple curve drawer, that just connects the dots for various 
// points (using Pvector iterators).  Draws a curve with line segments. 
// The final step draws the points themselves, in addition to the lines.

// This does use old-style glBegin... glEnd commands for drawing the lines. 
// We also use old-style opengl commands for glColor3f and glLineWidth.  
// If you are enterprising, you may want to try re-doing this with buffer objs
// The point drawing routines similarly use older OpenGL commands.
